# Types of Trees in Data Structures

## 1. Binary Tree
- **Description:** Each node has at most two children (left and right).
- **Real-world use case:** Expression parsing, hierarchical data representation.

## 2. Binary Search Tree (BST)
- **Description:** A binary tree where left child < parent < right child.
- **Real-world use case:** Efficient searching and sorting, database indexing.

## 3. AVL Tree
- **Description:** A self-balancing binary search tree.
- **Real-world use case:** Maintaining sorted data with fast lookup, insertion, and deletion.

## 4. Red-Black Tree
- **Description:** A balanced binary search tree with color properties.
- **Real-world use case:** Used in many libraries (e.g., Java TreeMap, C++ STL map/set).

## 5. B-Tree
- **Description:** A self-balancing search tree for large blocks of data.
- **Real-world use case:** Database and file system indexing.

## 6. Heap (Binary Heap)
- **Description:** A complete binary tree used to implement priority queues.
- **Real-world use case:** Task scheduling, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.

## 7. Trie (Prefix Tree)
- **Description:** A tree for storing strings where nodes represent common prefixes.
- **Real-world use case:** Autocomplete, spell checking.

## 8. Segment Tree
- **Description:** A tree for storing intervals or segments.
- **Real-world use case:** Range query problems (e.g., sum, minimum).
