/* 
  A closure would typically be used if we wanted to retain state between multiple function calls â€” for example, 
  if we wanted to incrementally rotate an array over time, retaining the state of the array between function calls. 
  But in this case, everything is handled within a single function call, so there's no need to use a closure.
